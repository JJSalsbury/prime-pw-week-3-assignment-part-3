      <ul>
        <li>I decided to edit my homework assignments using template literals after I recieved some feed back about it in last weeks homework. I see how versitle they can be. I noticed while console checking my work, using template literals turned some values from blue to black on the console? What exactly is going on here? Just curious about it... </li>
        <li>Can for loops and while loops always be used interchangeably?</li>
        <li>We covered the developer tools in the console. It was pretty interstng material, but we didn't really excercise any skills with it in the homework... will we be using these tools often or cover the devloper tools information again with more depth?</li>
