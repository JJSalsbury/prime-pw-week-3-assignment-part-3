      <h2>Check the console...</h2>
    </header>
      <ul>
        <li>I decided to edit my homework assignments using template literals after I recieved some feed back about it in last weeks homework. I see how versitle they can be. I noticed while console checking my work, using template literals turned some values from blue to black on the console? What exactly is going on here? Just curious about it... </li>
        <li>I tried using back ticks when making my favorite foods array in the Array Practice, question 1a. It allows for some freedom with spacing each value apart so that it looks grammatically correct when displayed in the console. I also changed the animalArray and used back ticks... But doing this, affected how the console would display when using an array's index to log... what is happening here?</li>
        <li>Can for loops and while loops always be used interchangeably?</li>
        <li>We covered the developer tools in the console during week 2. It was pretty interstng material, but we didn't really excercise any skills with it in the homework... will we be using these tools often or cover the devloper tools information again with more depth?</li>
